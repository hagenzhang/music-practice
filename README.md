# Music Practice Helper

## Description
This program was made in order to help faciliate my practice routine.
Each challenge type in this program is meant to test a guitarist's basic skills.

Each challenge has 4 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Rapid.
The Rapid difficulty is a combination of all the previous 3 difficulties, plus
a shortened prompt for a more streamlined practice session once the user develops
an understanding of how the challenge works.
